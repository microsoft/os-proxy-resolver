# Third-party notices

`pac-eval` embeds the QuickJS-NG JavaScript engine. The engine's C sources
are vendored and compiled by the `rquickjs-sys` Rust crate, which this crate
depends on. Both are MIT-licensed.

No code from any GPL/LGPL or otherwise copyleft-licensed PAC implementation
(such as pacparser, libproxy, or Chromium's PAC library) was used, consulted,
translated, or paraphrased in this crate. All PAC helper functions were
implemented from the public PAC specification: the Netscape "Navigator Proxy
Auto-Config File Format" document (1996) and Microsoft's published
documentation of the IPv6 PAC extensions.
